# CI-CD-Pipeline
AWS Deployment Pipeline Overview

ðŸš€ Welcome to the AWS CI-CD project! In this guide, we'll show you how to effortlessly automate your code's journey from source to deployment using AWS services.

Our goal is to:

    Create a Deployment Target
    Set up servers to run your code effortlessly, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk managing everything for you.

    Build the Pipeline
    Connect your source code (from GitHub or other sources) to your deployment target using AWS Code Pipeline.

    Test the Pipeline
    Validate the pipeline by making changes to your code and witnessing automatic updates.

Why Automation Matters

In today's fast-paced development environment, automation is your secret weapon. It helps you ensure consistency, reduce errors, and speed up the delivery of your applications. AWS provides a powerful suite of tools to help you achieve this, and we'll explore them in this guide.
Setting Up Your Deployment Target

Creating a robust foundation for your code deployment is crucial. In this project, we'll walk you through setting up your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. It's a hassle-free way to run your applications as AWS takes care of server management and scaling.
Building the Deployment Pipeline

Next, we'll dive into the heart of automation: building a deployment pipeline with AWS Code Pipeline. This allows you to establish a smooth and efficient workflow where changes to your source code trigger automatic builds, tests, and deployments.
Testing the Waters

Automation can seem daunting until you witness its magic. In the final part of our guide, we'll test the deployment pipeline by making code changes and watching the pipeline spring into action. It's a satisfying experience to see your application update effortlessly.
